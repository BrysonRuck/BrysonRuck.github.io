        <h2>What is Python</h2>
        <p>Out of the three programming languages talked about on this website.  Python is probably
            the easiest for new coders to learn.  since most of the code is very straight forward.
            it's main issue being the fact that it's very picky about indentation. Python is another high
            level coding language and it is also object oriented. Python is also an open source program.
            it was made in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
