    <h2>What is C++</h2>
    <p>C++ is a very usefull programming language that is used in a ton of different areas such as operating systems, apps, and also video games.  C++ is also considered a high
        level programming language since it is a language that we actually write in and then that code gets sent into assembly. C++ is also a object oriented programming language unlike 
    it's parent C.  C++ was made off of C, but it became object oriented and also allowed for things like classes. C++ also originally came out all the way back in 1979, but it was called C with classes back then
