        <h3><b>History of programming languages</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All the way back in 1843 Ada Lovelace figured out that Charles Babbage's difference machine could be used in a different way and numbers could represent different things</li>
            <li>In 1936 Alex Turring thought of the idea of a machine that could follow specific instructions</li>
            <li>In 1940 Konrad Zuse created plankalkul which was the first programming language</li>
            <li>1949 Asembelly language was made which we still use today since it works directly with the parts of a computer</li>
        </ul>
